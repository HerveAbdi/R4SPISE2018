# R4SPISE2018 .0.1.0

 A set of data sets, scripts, and vignettes 
 used for the *Advanced Workshop of the 2018 SPISE Meeting*
 that took place in Da Nang, Vietnam: July 20 to July 30, 2018. 

## Workshop: *individual differences* in sensory evaluation

## Packages to install prior to installing this package

Prior to installing the `R4SPISE2018` package, 
we need to install some other packages (mostly from `Github`).

```{r}
# decomment the line below if devtools is not yet installed
# install.packages('devtools') 
install.packages('factoextra')
devtools::install_github('HerveAbdi/PTCA4CATA')
devtools::install_github('HerveAbdi/DistatisR')
devtools::install_github('HerveAbdi/data4PCCAR')
```

## How to install the package with devtools < 2.0

To install the package `R4SPISE2018`, with `devtools`
older than version 2.0, 
use the following `R`-command:
```{r}
# install.packages('devtools') 
# decomment this line if devtools is not yet installed
devtools::install_github('HerveAbdi/R4SPISE2018', 
       dependencies = TRUE, # use it first time only, comment after
       build_vignettes = TRUE) # to get the vignettes       
```
The installation of the "dependent" packages can take some time and
building the vignettes can take also a bit of time to build:
So, be patient!


## How to install the package with devtools >  2.0

IMPORTANT: From version 2.0 onwards, devtools has changed its options and now
the parameter `build_vignettes` is (silently) ignored. This option is now integrated
in the parameter `build_opts` which passes options for `CMD build`  and which, by default
include the following options `build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual",
"--no-build-vignettes")`. So
with `devtools` version 2.0 or more recent,
the option `build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual",
"--no-build-vignettes")`
needs to be eliminated in the new call to `devtools` and replaced
by the new option `build_opts` as:
```{r}
# install.packages('devtools') 
# decomment this line  if devtools is not yet installed
devtools::install_github('HerveAbdi/R4SPISE2018', 
dependencies = TRUE, # use it first time only, comment after
build_opts = c("--no-resave-data") ) # to get the vignettes       
```

The installation of the "dependent" packages can take some time and
building the vignettes can take also a bit of time to build:
So, be patient!

## How to build the vignettes

If you have forgotten to build the vignettes, you can build them with
the command:
```{r}
devtools::build_vignettes()
```
Again, be prepared to wait till the vignettes are built.

## Main statistical techniques and R-packages used

1. Distatis: package `DistatisR`
2. Partial Triadic Correspondence Analysis (PTCA): package `PTCA4CATA`
3. Various helper functions for Multiple Correspondence Analysis from package `data4PCCAR`
4. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA): package `ExPosition`

### Where to download the packages

1. `ExPosition` can be downloaded from `CRAN`
2. `DistatisR`, `PTCA4CATA`, and `data4PCCAR`should be downloaded from `HerveAbdi/Github`.

## Current Vignettes


### beersCATA		

*Correspondence Analysis for CATA:*

Novices and experts evaluated 9 beers.

### cheeseMCA	

*Multiple Correspondence Analysis:*

Analyzing a survey about cheese

### fermentationIn2NationsMCA

*MCA with supplementary observations and variables; and new graphs.:*

Analysis of a survey about attitudes towards fermented food answered by 373 participants (220 French and 183 Vietnamese). The demographics of the participants is used as supplementary variables.
In addition, 30 participants from the SPISE2018 advanced workshop answered the questionnaire and are considered as supplementary observations.

This example also shows how to create PCA -like graphs for the qualitative variables: correlation, contributions, and bootstrap ratios. It uses several news functions from the package `data4PCCAR` (see `HerveAbdi/data4PCCAR` fro, `Github` )


### multiculturalSortingSpices	

*DISTATIS:*

Analyzing a sorting task with different groups of assessors.

### sortingNoodlesInAsia

*DISTATIS (with vocabulary and barycentric projections):*

Analyzing a sorting task of pictures of Ramen Noodles
with verbal description of the groups made by  the participants.

 A set of data sets, scripts, and vignettes

## Workshop: *individual differences* in sensory evaluation

## Packages to install prior to installing this package

Prior to installing the `R4SPISE2018` package, 
we need to install some other packages (mostly from `Github`).

```{r}
# decomment the line below if devtools is not yet installed
# install.packages('devtools') 
install.packages('factoextra')
devtools::install_github('HerveAbdi/PTCA4CATA')
devtools::install_github('HerveAbdi/DistatisR')
devtools::install_github('HerveAbdi/data4PCCAR')
```

## How to install the package

To install the package `R4SPISE2018`, use the following `R`-command:
```{r}
# install.packages('devtools') # decomment this line 
if devtools is not yet installed
devtools::install_github('HerveAbdi/R4SPISE2018', 
       dependencies = TRUE, # use it first time only, comment after
       build_vignettes = TRUE) # to get the vignettes
```
The installation of the "dependent" packages can take some time and
building the vignettes can take also a bit of time to build:
So, be patient!

## How to build the vignettes

If you have forgotten to build the vignettes, you can build them with
the command:
```{r}
devtools::build_vignettes()
```
Again, be prepared to wait till the vignettes are built.
